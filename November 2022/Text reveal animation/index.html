      Here we break up the text by nesting spans inside the main title. This will allow for different animation delays.
    
      NOTE: This would normally be used on 2-3 words and not a lot as shown here in this demo.
      Also, keep in mind that this works only on refresh. This means that if you want to use this,
      you have to add this to the text that shows up on your website's hero section (the first section visible to the user when they visit your site).
      In order to make this work on scroll when the elements come into view, JavaScript is required. 
    -->
    <h1 class="title">
      <!-- Title-content will have general styles that apply to all spans. The second classes are for individual use for the different animation delays. -->
      <span class="title-content">Shoot</span>
      <span class="title-content title-second">your shot.</span>
      <span class="title-content title-third">You will always</span>
      <span class="title-content title-fourth">miss if you don't.</span>
